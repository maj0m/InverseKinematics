Procedural Gecko Movement Simulation using Inverse Kinematics

    This simulation attempts to mimic the movement of a lizard / gecko using inverse kinematics.
    The lizard is made up of segmented legs and a joint body using inverse kinematics.

How to use:
    You can try it out at: maj0m.github.io/InverseKinematics

Controls:
    The gecko follows the cursor, thats it!

Dependencies:
    This simulation was built using the p5.js library, which is included in the repository. No additional dependencies are required.
